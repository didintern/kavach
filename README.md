## Introduction

Cavach offers a Privacy First Aadhaar Verification solution to assist businesses in complying with evolving data protection and privacy laws in India. The platform emphasizes maintaining privacy while facilitating identity verification.

## Evolving Regulatory Landscape

Newly enforced Data Protection & Privacy Law highlights two key takeaways for businesses:

- Businesses need to disclose details about the collection, storage, sharing, and processing of citizen data.
- Storing citizen data is discouraged due to potential fines, up to 250 Cr, in the event of data breaches.

## Problems

Current KYC practices encounter several challenges:

- **Unregulated Industries:** Traditional KYC methods overlook unregulated sectors such as Banking, Insurance, and Telecom, hindering identity verification for businesses in India.
- **High Integration Costs:** Integrating standard KYC solutions comes with high costs, deterring growth for small non-regulated businesses.
- **Data Privacy Risks:** Ad-Hoc KYC methods in non-regulated areas risk data mishandling, potentially breaching DPDP23 regulations and eroding trust.
- **DPDPâ€™23 Complexity:** Aligning KYC with the Data Protection Act of 2023 poses challenges in non-regulated sectors.

## Business Integration Use Cases

Cavach offers solutions for various business scenarios:

- **ATOM X:** Age Verification for liquor distribution.
